# Writing_Loops_Project1 (Due 01/25/21)

For this project, we can start basic. Then, as we do more projects together, we can increase our complexity and efficiency. 
This project is broken down into 10 questions and a reflection. 
Let's split this project into two questions per person, and I'll take care of the leftover questions. For the reflection, if anyone would like to tackle it, just let us know in GroupMe or write your name in below.

Salvador Aleguas - Questions 1 and 2, one function and markdown cell for queston 10
Denise Do - Questions 3 and 4, one function and markdown cell for queston 10
Nicholas Velasco - Questions 5 and 6, one function and markdown cell for queston 10
Thomas Boosinger - Questions 7 - 9, one function and markdown cell for queston 10

Reflections - ?

To submit your work to the group, you can edit the main file in GitHub, upload a separate file of just your questions (and I can add them in), or if you wish, you can fork the project and open it in Juypter Notebook and then submit a pull request (https://youtu.be/k5D37W6h56o)
